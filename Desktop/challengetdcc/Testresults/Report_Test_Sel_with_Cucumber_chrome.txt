  Scenario: I visit the web application "https://www.getminimalist.com/"                 # D:/eclipse/myProject/challengetdcc/src/test/resources/AddListchromecc.feature:4
    Given I refresh the todo list, to erase old register                                 # AddListchromecc.i_refresh_the_todo_list_to_erase_old_register()
    When I click in the field Add to your list                                           # AddListchromecc.i_click_in_the_field_Add_to_your_list()
    Then I can insert into the list "My task 01/03", "My task 02/03" and "My task 03/03" # AddListchromecc.i_can_insert_into_the_list_and(String,String,String)
    Then I can ckeck all tasks into the list                                             # AddListchromecc.i_can_ckeck_all_tasks_into_the_list()
    Then I can finalize the test automation                                              # AddListchromecc.i_can_finalize_the_test_automation()
